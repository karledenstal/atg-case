# ATG Case

Bootstrapped with Vite + React + Typescript.

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)
- [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [msw](https://mswjs.io/) + [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

**Note:** Tests are definitely my weakest part. Set it up using `msw` and `vitest`, but I'm too unfamiliar with it to be confident in the tests. I have done it in a way so all tests have been verified to work by failing at first.

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
